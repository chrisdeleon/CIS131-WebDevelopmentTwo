    <p class="goal-text">So far I have taken a couple programming/coding classes such as Web Site Development I and Intro to Computer Programming. I took these courses in partial fulfillment of the Associate of Science in Computer Science degree offered at OTC. Initially, going to school had not crossed my mind. I took a year’s worth of classes at a different college and I soon realized that what I was studying wasn’t really what I wanted for myself. Not too long after, I got into coding and I enjoyed doing it. Without having anyone to ask me or force me to do it, I started small projects. I figured that if this is something I truly enjoy then going to college for it would be worthwhile.<br>I am taking this particular class because my favorite of all things programming/coding related is website design. In Web Site Development I, I enjoyed every project we were assigned and working on other things than the ones that caught my attention helped me direct my practice in areas that I’m not very strong in. I believe this class will further enhance my web site development skills and I’m excited to add more projects to my repertoire.<br>Feel free to reach out to me with any questions!
